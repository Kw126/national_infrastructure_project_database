Canada’s infrastructure is managed by many different governments and agencies, leading to inconsistent data, information gaps, and poor coordination. Without a unified view of asset condition and maintenance needs, planning and investment decisions become inefficient and reactive. Proper infrastructure eases the flow of people and goods, helps people stay connected, and keeps people healthy, happy, and safe. Therefore, a centralized infrastructure database is needed to provide accurate, consistent, and accessible information so governments can make better-informed, timely decisions to maintain safe and reliable infrastructure, ensuring the success of the communities that depend on said infrastructure.
