Canada’s infrastructure is managed by many different governments and agencies, leading to inconsistent data, information gaps, and poor coordination. Without a unified view of asset condition and maintenance needs, planning and investment decisions become inefficient and reactive. A centralized infrastructure database is needed to provide accurate, consistent, and accessible information so governments can make better-informed, timely decisions to maintain safe and reliable infrastructure.
